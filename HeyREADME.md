# Hey Day Script
## What is Hey Day?
Hey Day is a tradition at Auburn University. Every year, there is a day where everyone gathers on the Auburn green space to get a name tag to begin their Hey Day. The person will then go about their day while saying hey to everyone they pass that has a name tag. It is just a fun tradition to make new friends and experience the Auburn family lifestyle.

## Below is a script for my Hey Day program.

### Create a text file.

### Include a shebang:
>! /bin/bash

### Include a line to prompt the user to type their name.
>echo "Enter your name"

### Prompt the program to read user input as a variable name.
>read name

### Say Hey to the user using their name!
>echo "Hey, $name !"
